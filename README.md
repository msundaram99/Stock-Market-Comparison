# Analyzing the Sensitivity of Apple and Google Stocks to Market Movements
In this analysis, we evaluate how Apple and Google stocks react to fluctuations in the broader U.S. stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 index. By assessing their sensitivity, we gain insights into their relative volatility and risk levels.

The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor’s 500) is one of the most widely followed stock market indices in the United States. It comprises 500 of the largest publicly traded companies, selected based on market capitalization, liquidity, and industry representation. Because these companies span multiple sectors, the index provides a comprehensive measure of the overall stock market’s health and performance.

# Understanding Beta Values

In the output, Apple’s beta value is approximately 1.2257, meaning its stock is about 22.57% more volatile than the broader market. Similarly, Google’s beta value is around 1.5303, indicating it is 53.03% more volatile compared to the market.

A beta greater than 1 suggests that a stock tends to experience larger price swings than the market itself. Since both Apple and Google have beta values above 1, they are expected to be more sensitive to market fluctuations. Additionally, Google’s higher beta (1.5303) suggests that it carries a greater degree of risk and responsiveness to market trends than Apple. Investors should take this into account, as higher-beta stocks can offer increased return potential but also come with elevated risk.
